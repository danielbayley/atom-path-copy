Add context menu options to the tab context menu to copy the open editor file path.

```

Or Settings/Preferences ➔ Packages ➔ Search for `path-copy`

## Usage

Open the [Tab Context Menu](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/context-menu-manager.coffee), and  select which file path you would like to copy from the [Path Copy](https://atom.io/packages/path-copy) sub-menu.

The benefit of `path-copy` is that the package uses the path of the tab where the context menu was called, rather than only being able to retrieve the path of the active tab.
